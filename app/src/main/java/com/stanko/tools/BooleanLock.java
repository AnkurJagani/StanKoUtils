 * Intended to some Thread based or async tasks to be synchronized on this object.
 * Some task tries to mark it has been started using setRunning(). If method returns true
 * its marked as running otherwise means some other thread started the same job already.
 * When the job is done the task or thread should mark it using setFinished() method so other
 * threads could restart or repeat the same job.
